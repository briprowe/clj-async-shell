* clj-async-shell

Make use of clojure.java.shell asynchronously.  

NOTE: This library is currently a *long* way from what it could be. It
is a quick one off written in support of a larger project. I suggest
you look into using [[http://clojurewise.blogspot.com/2011/02/popen-sub-process-library.html][popen]] instead.

** Usage

Add this to the dependencies in your project.clj:

#:BEGIN_SRC clojure
   [clj-async-shell "0.0.2-SNAPSHOT"]
#:END_SRC
